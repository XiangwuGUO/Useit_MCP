  You are tasked with analyzing an MCP server implementation and generating a JSON description file named `mcp_server_desc.json`. This file helps AI systems understand
   the server's capabilities for task planning purposes.

  ## Analysis Requirements

  1. **Read the server implementation**: Examine the main server file (usually `server.py`) and any related documentation
  2. **Identify all MCP tools**: Look for functions decorated with `@mcp.tool()`
  3. **Understand tool functionality**: Analyze what each tool does, its parameters, and return values

  ## Output Format

  Generate a JSON file with exactly two keys:

  ```json
  {
    "simple_desc": "Brief one-line summary of the server's primary capabilities",
    "complete_desc": "Detailed description of all available tools and their functions"
  }

  Content Guidelines

  simple_desc

  - Single sentence (50-80 words)
  - Highlight the main purpose and key features
  - Use descriptive keywords that capture the essence

  complete_desc

  - Focus ONLY on tool functionality
  - Describe what each tool can do in practical terms
  - Use action-oriented language ("You can...", "Use X to...", "Handle Y with...")
  - Mention key parameters and capabilities
  - Keep it concise but comprehensive
  - Avoid implementation details, architecture descriptions, or technical internals
  - Target audience: AI systems doing task planning

  Example Structure for complete_desc

  "This [server type] provides tools for [main purpose]. You can [tool1 function] using tool1. [Tool2 function] with tool2, supporting [key features]. [Tool3 function]
   using tool3 with [parameters/options]. [Continue for all tools]. All operations [mention any important constraints or sandbox info]."

  What NOT to include in complete_desc

  - Technical implementation details
  - Architecture descriptions
  - Security mechanisms (unless they affect tool usage)
  - Configuration details
  - Framework information
  - Performance characteristics
  - Error handling specifics

  Focus purely on "what can this server help me accomplish" from a task planning perspective.

  Finally， create a mcp_server_desc.json in the mcp server folder。
