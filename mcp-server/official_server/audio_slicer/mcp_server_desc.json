  "simple_desc": "A specialized audio processing server that intelligently slices audio files into segments based on beat detection, supporting various audio formats through base64 input and generating musically coherent segments at specified durations.",
  "complete_desc": "This audio processing server provides tools for intelligent audio segmentation. You can slice audio files into segments using slice_audio, which accepts base64-encoded audio content, the original filename, and target segment duration in seconds. The tool uses beat detection algorithms to cut audio at musically meaningful boundaries, ensuring segments maintain musical integrity rather than arbitrary time cuts. You can process various audio formats including MP3, WAV, and other common formats. The tool returns a list of file paths to the generated audio segments along with a success message indicating the number of segments created. All operations work with base64-encoded input for network transmission and generate WAV output files."
