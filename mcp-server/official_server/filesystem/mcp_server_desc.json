  "complete_desc": "This filesystem server provides tools for file and directory operations within a sandboxed environment. You can list directory contents with optional recursive traversal and pattern filtering using list_dir. Get file or directory information with stat. Read and write text files using read_text and write_text, with support for different encodings and append mode. Handle binary files with read_binary and write_binary using base64 encoding. Create directories with mkdir. Copy files or directories with copy, move or rename them with move, and delete files or directories with delete including recursive deletion for directories. Extract text content from Office documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX) using read_office_text. Synchronize files to remote locations using sync_files_to_target with multiple comparison strategies (size, hash, etag) and dry-run capability. All operations work within the configured base directory sandbox and support session isolation."
